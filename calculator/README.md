# Programming101 - Weekend Calculator Project 🧮

A beginner-friendly calculator app built using TypeScript and `ts-node`.  
This project is part of my learning journey during the fullstack bootcamp.

## 🚀 Features

- Read operation metadata from a JSON file
- Supports basic arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Modular code structure (easy to extend later)
